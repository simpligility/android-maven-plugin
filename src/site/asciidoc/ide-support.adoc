= IDE Support

The Android Maven Plugin should work well with any IDE that has support for Android development and Maven projects. 
All this is managed by external projects. In the following are a few pointers.

== Eclipse

This works fine for full development. You will need to have ADT, http://eclipse.org/m2e/[M2Eclipse] 
and http://rgladwell.github.io/m2e-android/[m2e-android] installed. In the future this 
might work become even better with https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.andmore[Andmore].
Eclipse developers have contributed features to this plugin.

== IntelliJ/Android Studio

This works fine for full development. 

== Netbeans

This works fine for full development. Netbeans developers have contributed features to this plugin.
